# MATLAB-Cartoon Filter
Backup of different projects made by me using MATLAB. It contains things such as signal processing, image processing and data analysis.

Aha! Now the readme is under my control!

The general process can be summarized into the following steps:

· Defining and applying an *Anisotropic Diffusion filter*

· k-Mean *Clustering* of the colors in the filtered image

· *Replacing the colors* in the filtered image with the new color mapping from the clusters

· *Recovering borders* and adding them do the filtered image

· Profit
